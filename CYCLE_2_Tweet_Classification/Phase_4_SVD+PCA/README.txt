### 🔁 ACM 30-Day AI & Data Science Challenge – Cycle 2: Boost & Bag

## ✅ Tasks Completed

📌 TF-IDF Vectorization | Converted raw text into numerical features with 10,000 terms |
📌 Dimensionality Reduction | Applied Truncated SVD to reduce from 10,000D to 2D |
📌 PCA Alternative (Optional) | Considered PCA for dense input variant |
📌 2D Visualization | Plotted reduced data using true labels and clusters |
📌 KMeans Clustering (Optional) | Clustered into 20 groups, compared to actual categories |
📌 Evaluation Metric | Used Silhouette Score to assess clustering quality |
